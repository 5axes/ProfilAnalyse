# Profil Analyser
Cura profil analyser ( initialy based on the GodMod Plugin https://github.com/sedwards2009/cura-god-mode-plugin )

Plugin for Cura to analyse my Cura profils configuration much easier.

This plugins lets you dump the contents of the curent global and extruder settings stacks to a HTML page which opens up in your default brouwser. There you can inspect the values and also filter the list of settings.

To install just copy the ProfilAnalyser directory into the plugins/ directory in your Cura source code.

Once Cura is running you can find the plugin on the Extensions menu -> Profil Analyse.
